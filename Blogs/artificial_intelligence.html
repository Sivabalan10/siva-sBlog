	 		Hello! I'm Sivabalan, and I'm excited to discuss Artificial Intelligence (AI) with you. AI is a big deal for the future, and in this blog, I'll cover AI, Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), which involve cool things like neural networks and natural language processing (NLP). I'll share my learning journey as a blog to help you understand these concepts better. Additionally, I'll provide real-life projects for each concept on my linked page.

	 		<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
	 		Artificial Intelligence refers to programs that can think, reason, and solve problems. It's like teaching computers to be smart and make decisions.

	 		<h2>Types of AI:</h2>
	 		<ul>
	 			<li><b>Narrow AI:</b> This type of AI is specialized for specific tasks, like playing chess or recognizing faces.</li>
	 			<li><b>General AI:</b> Imagine a super-smart AI that can handle any task a human can. That's the idea behind General AI, but we're not there yet.</li>
	 			<li><b>Super AI:</b> This is an AI that's smarter than humans in every way. It's a bit like what you see in sci-fi movies, where AI surpasses human intelligence.</li>
	 		</ul>
	 		Understanding AI types helps us see how smart these programs can be. AI is like having a really clever friend who can learn and solve problems, and it's shaping the future in amazing ways!
